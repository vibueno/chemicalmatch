## Live

## Design
* Mobile first: the styles included in the file styles.css are optimized for a minimum width of 240px. The file responsiveness.css builds on styles.css by providing additional styles which make the site work correctly on bigger viewports.

## Programming
* Fully responsive (starting at 240px of *Unihertz Jelly Pro*, as fas as I know the smallest Smartphone widely available)
* Pseudoclassical pattern
* JavaScript Modules
* Event Delegation
* JavaScript Promises
