## Description

_Chemical Match_ is a classic memory game. The game revolves around finding matching cards. This project was developed within the frame of the _Front End Developer Nanodegree_ program at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) and greatly improved afterwards.

## Live

## Design

- Mobile first: the styles included in the main stylesheet are optimized for a minimum width of 240px. The file responsive.css builds on it by providing additional styles which make the site work correctly on bigger viewports.

## Programming

- **Fully responsive** (starting at 240px of _Unihertz Jelly Pro_, as fas as I know the smallest Smartphone widely available)
- Pseudoclassical pattern
- JavaScript Modules
- Event Delegation
- JavaScript Promises
